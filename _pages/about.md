I am a second year graduate student from Electrical Engineering, [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). 

I like to work on real-life human-centered applications. For example, natural language processing, audio signal analysis, etc. As one of the first authors, one of my works on emotion shareÂ prediction using large language model embeddings was been approved for publication in ACM Multimedia 2023 Multimedia Grand Challenges Track. Further, I am interested in studying any machine learning techniques that can help humans be more productive. For example, I am currently working on **Enhance 3D model generation with relevant but non-provided information**, advised by [Prof. Qi Zhu](http://eecs.northwestern.edu/~qzhu/) and **Generate formal method by analyzing network protocols**, advised by [Prof. Hai Zhou]().

My other research interest is in the field of robotics, specifically combining reinforcement learning with multi-agent systems. As an instance, I have worked on **Multi-agent reinforcement learning with communication disturbance**, advised by [Prof. Qi Zhu (http://eecs.northwestern.edu/~qzhu/). 

Before Northwestern, I did my undergrad in Electrical Engineering at [Chung Yuan Christian University](https://www.cycu.edu.tw/eng/).
